pynoflushd - hard disk drive spindown control daemon

Inspired by noflushd.

The problem I have with noflushd is I use soft raid. noflushd is not aware of
(virtual) block device dependencies, so it flushes any device it didn't ask to
spin down. The result is properly spinning down a physical drive, and right
next flush a raid device, spinning up disk again as raid superblock gets
refreshed.

This reimplementation fixes this - but looses many features I do not use:
- only one timeout supported, no sighandler to switch
- no reaction to irq usage (I use this on a file server, so monitoring disk
  usage is all I need)
- relies on hdparm to send sleep command, and query drive state
Patches welcome.

Of course, it preserves the main noflushd feature: allow spinning down a drive
with no recent *read* access, regardless of *write* accesses. Your data will
reside in ram for longer than if your disk was left spinning (until the next
explicit flush call actually), so consider this risk.

Block device hierarchy should work with cryptsetup & lvm devices as well as
mdadm raid, but hasn't been checked.
